# Triple Triad

___
### This is a reimagining of one of my favorite games within a game, Triple Triad, from Final Fantasy VIII.
___

It has the basic setup and ruleset of the original game minus some extra features such as elements.

This project was created with the intention of using only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. With that, if you'd like to give it a whirl, go ahead and clone the repo to your local machine and copy and paste the index.html file into your browser's address bar and hit enter. 

In it's current state it only supports a single player playing both sides, but creates the framework with which we will continue to grow this project! A second version using the React JS library will begin development soon! 

<ins>Possible features for the React version include:</ins>
* Builadble Decks
* Elemental Attributes
* Rule Variations
* Online Multiplayer
* Winner Keeper Cards
* Enhcanced Graphics & Animations
* Mobile Friendly Responsive Layout
* Multi Round Games
* Card Packs/Opening

I'll keep a running list here and I am open to any ideas as I would love to try and figure out how to incorporate them! Keep in mind this is more of a spitball list and some features may not ultimately make it. The goal is to have a fun learning experience and resource for whomever finds it useful/entertaining!
